## Usage Examples

### Playing an Episode

// Play an episode
await playerProvider.playEpisode(episode);
```

### Using QuickPlayButton

```dart
QuickPlayButton(
  episode: episode,
  size: 32,
  color: Colors.blue,
)
```

### Using FullPlaybackControls

```dart
FullPlaybackControls(
  episode: episode,
  showProgress: true,
)
```

### Monitoring Player State

```dart
Consumer<PlayerProvider>(
  builder: (context, playerProvider, child) {
    return Text('Currently playing: ${playerProvider.currentEpisode?.title ?? 'None'}');
  },
)
```

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Add to Your App

Ensure your app has the PlayerProvider in the widget tree:

```dart
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    // Other providers...
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => PlayerProvider()),
  ],
  child: MyApp(),
)
```

### 2. Add MiniPlayer to Your Layout

Include the MiniPlayer in your main scaffold:

```dart
Scaffold(
  body: Column(
    children: [
      Expanded(child: YourMainContent()),
      Consumer<PlayerProvider>(
        builder: (context, playerProvider, child) {
          if (playerProvider.currentEpisode == null) {
            return const SizedBox.shrink();
          }
          return const MiniPlayer();
        },
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

### 3. Integrate with Episode Lists

Use EpisodeCard or add playback controls to your episode lists:

```dart
ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    final episode = episodes[index];
    return EpisodeCard(
      episode: episode,
      onTap: () => _showEpisodeDetails(episode),
    );
  },
)
```

## Configuration

### Audio Quality Settings

Audio quality can be configured through the UserProvider settings:

```dart
enum PlaybackQuality {
  low,     // 64 kbps
  standard, // 128 kbps
  high,    // 256 kbps
  ultra,   // 320 kbps
}
```

### Skip Durations

Default skip durations can be customized:
- Replay: 10 seconds
- Skip backward: 15 seconds  
- Skip forward: 30 seconds

## Demo

Try the Episode Playback Demo available in the Profile screen to see all features in action:

1. Open the app
2. Go to Profile tab
3. Tap on "Episode Playback Demo"
4. Explore different playback controls and features

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  just_audio: ^0.9.34
  audio_service: ^0.18.10
  provider: ^6.0.5
```

### Permissions

Android (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
```

iOS (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`):
```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

### Performance Considerations

- Episodes are loaded on-demand
- Playback position is saved every 30 seconds
- Memory-efficient audio streaming
- Automatic cleanup of unused resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Audio not playing**: Check internet connection and URL validity
2. **Background playback not working**: Verify permissions and audio session setup
3. **Progress not saving**: Ensure database service is initialized
4. **Controls not responding**: Check PlayerProvider state and error messages

### Debug Information

Use the Episode Playback Demo to view current player state and debug issues:
- Current episode
- Playback position
- Player state
- Error messages

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the playback system:

1. **Queue Management**: Play next/previous episodes
2. **Offline Playback**: Download episodes for offline listening
3. **Smart Speed**: Automatically adjust speed based on content
4. **Chapter Support**: Skip to specific chapters in episodes
5. **Sleep Timer**: Auto-stop playback after specified time
6. **Cross-fade**: Smooth transitions between episodes
7. **Equalizer**: Audio enhancement controls
