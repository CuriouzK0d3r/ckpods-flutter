```

### Navigation
```dart
// From subscription screen
void _navigateToPodcastDetail(Podcast podcast) {
  Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/podcast-detail', arguments: podcast);
}

// Route handling in main.dart
case '/podcast-detail':
  final podcast = settings.arguments as Podcast;
  return MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => PodcastDetailScreen(podcast: podcast),
  );
```
